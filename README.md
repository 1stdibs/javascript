# 1stdibs JavaScript Style Guide is dead

JavaScript coding style guides are unproductive. Their existence causes code reviews to be polluted with pedantic comments; requires developers to remember a bunch of fiddly (and -- let's face it -- arbitrary) rules; plus, ultimately, they don't achieve the desired result: code that follows a holistic style, written in a way so as to reduce errors.

Today, we have great tools to help not only code style, but more important rules which help us avoid common bugs.

# Long Live The 1stdibs Eslint Config Files!

We think [eslint](http://eslint.org/) is the best tool for enforcing  style rules, promoting best practices and helping to reduce common errors.

Instead of a style guide, check out our config files!
